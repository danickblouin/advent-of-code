# Advent of Code

My solutions to the Advent of Code.
Slowly relearning Python functionalities.
Most of the solutions are not really optimized, just participating for fun.

I did the harder problems by watching hyper-neutrino videos. Didn't have all the time
in the world to do the problems but I still wanted to learn new ways to do things so 
I pushed them in the repo anyway.
